Basic template using CMake to build a project for completing the [Vulkan Tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/). Install the Vulkan SDK, clone and build this repo with CMake, then start the tutorial at "Drawing a triangle" using your preferred IDE ie. VSCode. There is one test set up using doctest to check that everything works, much in the same way that the tutorial does in the "development environment" section.
