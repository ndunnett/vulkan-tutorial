Basic template using CMake to build a project for completing the [Vulkan Tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/). Install the Vulkan SDK, clone this repo, then start the tutorial at "Drawing a triangle" using your preferred IDE ie. VSCode. There is one test set up using doctest to check that everything works, much in the same way that the tutorial does in the "development environment" section.

See the "completed" branch for the completed tutorial, or the "rewrite" branch for my refactored version of the tutorial using Vulkan-Hpp.
